# Contributing to openGym

Thanks for taking a look! openGym is intentionally small and dependency-light, and the goal is
to keep it that way — easy to read, easy to self-host.

## Project layout

```
frontend/  React + Vite app (src/views, src/components, src/store, src/lib). Builds to static files.
           android/ + ios/ are the Capacitor shells for the standalone mobile app (docs/MOBILE.md).
api/       backend — server.js (Node, no framework), one dependency (@simplewebauthn/server).
web/       multi-stage Dockerfile (builds frontend → nginx) + nginx.conf (serves app, proxies /api).
media/     exercise img/gif (gitignored, fetched at runtime).
docs/      self-hosting guide.
```

## Running for development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build      # api + web + media on :8080
# frontend hot reload:
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
# training logic (progression rules, 1RM, how a session is read back):
cd frontend && npm test
```

## Guidelines

- **Keep it dependency-light.** The frontend uses React + Router + Zustand and nothing else;
  new deps (front or back) are a hard sell. `api/` has two (`@simplewebauthn/server` for passkeys,
  `web-push` for notifications) — keep it near that.
- **Match the style.** Small components, clear names, comments only where the "why" isn't obvious.
  State lives in the Zustand store (`src/store`); pure helpers in `src/lib`.
- **Don't commit** the exercise media (`media/`) or `data/` — they're gitignored.
- **Test the flow** you touched — click through the affected screens (and the workout flow) in a
  browser before opening a PR.
- **Training logic gets a unit test.** Anything deciding what you lift next, or reading a logged
  session back, belongs in a pure helper in `src/lib` with tests beside it (`npm test`). These
  rules are easy to get subtly wrong and nearly impossible to verify by clicking — the
  progression engine grew two real bugs that only a test pinned down.

## Good first issues

- Additional starter plans (upper/lower, full-body, 5×5…)
- More languages for the exercise instructions (the dataset ships several)
- Percentage / training-max programming (5/3/1-style) on top of the progression engine in
  `src/lib/progression.js` — the policy interface is already there
- Accessibility passes on the workout and chart screens

## Where to ask what

| You have | Goes to |
| --- | --- |
| A question, or self-hosting that won't behave | Upstream: [gitlab.com/DuarteSantos8/opengym](https://gitlab.com/DuarteSantos8/opengym) |
| An idea for the core app | Upstream, same place — that's where it can actually land |
| A bug in the AI Coach | Nowhere official: the fork that added it has issues switched off |
| Something broken **in this fork specifically** | An issue here |
| A change you've already built | A pull request here |

This fork is published as-is: it exists to fix an install path that could not deliver the AI
Coach. It is not a maintained distribution and promises no response time. Anything about the
tracker itself belongs upstream, where the project is alive and where an answer helps the next
person who searches for it.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with: what you did, what you expected, what happened, and your browser/OS. If it's
about login/passkeys, include your `RP_ID`/`ORIGIN` (not the `data/` contents) — most login
issues are an origin mismatch.
